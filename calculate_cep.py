    Calculates the Circular Error Probable (CEP) for a set of two-dimensional
    data points.

    CEP is a measure of the accuracy of a system, defined as the radius of a
    circle centered on the mean of the data that contains 50% of the data points.
    This calculation assumes the data follows a bivariate normal distribution.

    Args:
        coordinates (list of tuples or numpy.ndarray): A list of (x, y)
            coordinate pairs representing the data points.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated CEP value.
